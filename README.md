This application simulates the recent trend of surprise mechanics known as lootboxes. Offering three separate boxes of different drop rates and rewards, these can be opened, which an animation will play and will determine what reward the player will get. The app also offers a stats page, where it will display the amount of boxes the user has opened, their favourite crate, and how many times the user has gotten a specific reward.
